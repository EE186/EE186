Welcome to EE186, an introductory course on embedded systems!

This course focuses on the key principles and practices of modern embedded system design, including specification, design, development, and testing. The topics covered in this course include comptuer architecture, general purpose input output (GPIO), clocks, interrupts, busses, and storage. The lectures will focus broadly on the principles of embedded systems and microcontrollers, and these learnings will be solified through hands on lab assignments and by working with an ARM Cortex M microcontroller. The class will culminate in a final project where teams of students will apply what they have learned throughout the quarter to design, build, and test there own wireless embedded system.
